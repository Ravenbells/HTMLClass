                        France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] Listen), officially the French Republic (French: République
                        française),[14]
                        is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe and overseas regions and territories in
                        the
                        Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.[XIII] Its metropolitan area extends from
                        the
                        Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North
                        Sea;
                        overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the
                        North
                        Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. Due to its
                        several coastal territories, France has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France
                        borders Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Andorra, and Spain in
                        continental
                        Europe, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname, and Brazil in the Americas via its overseas
                        territories in French Guiana and Saint Martin. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are
                        overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of
                        May
                        2021).[5] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the
                        country's
                        largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille,
                        Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, and Nice.

                        Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic
                        tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct
                        Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks formed
                        the
                        Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun
                        of
                        843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. In the High
                        Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly decentralised feudal kingdom. Philip II
                        successfully
                        strengthened royal power and defeated his rivals to double the size of the crown lands; by the
                        end
                        of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe. From the mid-14th to the
                        mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England,
                        collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a
                        result.
                        The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, conflict with the House of Habsburg, and
                        the
                        establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the
                        second-largest
                        in the world.[15] The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars
                        between
                        Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country. France again emerged as Europe's
                        dominant power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War.[16]
                        Inadequate
                        economic policies, inequitable taxes and frequent wars (notably a defeat in the Seven Years' War
                        and
                        costly involvement in the American War of Independence), left the kingdom in a precarious
                        economic
                        situation by the end of the 18th century. This precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which
                        overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses
                        the
                        nation's ideals to this day.

                        France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon
                        Bonaparte,
                        subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French
                        Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. The collapse
                        of
                        the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous
                        succession
                        of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in
                        1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, as well
                        as
                        economic prosperity known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World
                        War
                        I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allied
                        powers
                        of World War II, but was soon occupied by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, the
                        short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian
                        War.
                        The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French
                        colonies
                        became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties
                        with
                        France.

                        France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. It
                        hosts
                        the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist
                        destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[17] France is a developed
                        country
                        with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest by PPP; in terms of
                        aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world.[18] France performs well in
                        international
                        rankings of education, health care, life expectancy and human development.[19][20] It remains a
                        great power in global affairs,[21] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations
                        Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member
                        of
                        the European Union and the Eurozone,[22] as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North
                        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
                        (OECD)
                        and La Francophonie.

                        Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian Republic or Republic of
                        Italy[12][13] (Italian: Repubblica Italiana [reˈpubblika itaˈljaːna]),[14][15] is a country that
                        consists of a peninsula delimited by the Alps and several islands surrounding it,[note 1] whose
                        territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region.[16] Italy is located in the
                        middle of the Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe;[17][18][19] it is also considered part of
                        Western Europe.[20][note 2] A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital and
                        largest
                        city, the country covers a total area of 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi) and shares land borders
                        with
                        France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, as well as the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and
                        San
                        Marino. Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland, Campione. With over 60 million
                        i,nhabitants,[21] Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy has
                        historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures. In addition to the various ancient
                        peoples
                        dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European
                        Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians
                        and
                        Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy,[22] Greeks established settlements in
                        the
                        so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy, while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and
                        northern
                        Italy respectively. An Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th
                        century
                        BC, which eventually became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The Roman
                        Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on the Italian peninsula, eventually
                        expanding and conquering parts of Europe, North Africa and Asia. By the first century BC, the
                        Roman
                        Empire emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural,
                        political and religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years
                        during
                        which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed.[23][24]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the
                        Barbarian
                        Invasions, but by the 11th century, numerous rival city-states and maritime republics, mainly in
                        the
                        northern and central regions of Italy, became prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking,
                        laying the groundwork for modern capitalism.[25] These mostly independent statelets served as
                        Europe's main trading hubs with Asia and the Near East, often enjoying a greater degree of
                        democracy
                        than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe; however, part of
                        central Italy was under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy
                        remained
                        largely feudal until the 19th century, partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine, Arab,
                        Norman, Angevin, Aragonese, and other foreign conquests of the region.[26] The Renaissance began
                        in
                        Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science,
                        exploration, and art. Italian culture flourished, producing famous scholars, artists, and
                        polymaths.
                        During the Middle Ages, Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New
                        World,
                        helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy's commercial and
                        political
                        power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes that bypassed the Mediterranean.[27]
                        Centuries of foreign conquest and meddling, and the rivalry and infighting between the Italian
                        city-states, such as the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically
                        fragmented, and it was further conquered and divided among multiple foreign European powers over
                        the
                        centuries.

                    <p>
                        By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism and calls for independence from foreign
                        control
                        led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval. After centuries of foreign domination and
                        political division, Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of independence,
                        establishing the Kingdom of Italy.[28] From the late 19th century to the early 20th century,
                        Italy
                        rapidly industrialised, mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire,[29] while the south
                        remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation, fuelling a large and
                        influential
                        diaspora.[30] Despite being one of the victorious allied powers in World War I, Italy entered a
                        period of economic crisis and social turmoil, leading to the rise of the Italian fascist
                        dictatorship in 1922. The participation of Fascist Italy in World War II on the Axis side and
                        against the Allies ended in military defeat, economic destruction, and the occupation of Italy
                        by
                        Nazi Germany and the collaborationist Italian Social Republic. Following the rise of the Italian
                        Resistance and the subsequent Italian Civil War and liberation of Italy, the country abolished
                        its
                        monarchy, established a democratic Republic, enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, and became a
                        highly
                        developed country.[31]

                        Italy has an advanced economy. The country is the ninth-largest by nominal GDP (third in the
                        European Union), the eighth-largest by national wealth and the third-largest by central bank
                        gold
                        reserve. It ranks highly in life expectancy, quality of life,[32] healthcare,[33] and education.
                        The
                        country is a great power, and it has a significant role in regional[34][35] and global[36][37]
                        economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic affairs. Italy is a founding and leading member of
                        the
                        European Union and a member of numerous international institutions, including the United
                        Nations,
                        NATO, the OECD, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the World Trade
                        Organization, the Group of Seven, the G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Latin Union, the
                        Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus, the Schengen Area, and many more. The source of many
                        inventions and discoveries, the country has long been a global centre of art, music, literature,
                        philosophy, science and technology, and fashion and has greatly influenced and contributed to
                        diverse fields including cinema, cuisine, sports, jurisprudence, banking, and business.[38] As a
                        reflection of its cultural wealth, Italy has the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites
                        (58), and is the fifth-most visited country.

                    Mexico,[a][b] officially the United Mexican States,[c] is a country in the southern portion of North
                    America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific
                    Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of
                    Mexico.[10] Mexico covers 1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 sq mi),[11] making it the world's
                    13th-largest country by area; with approximately 126,014,024 inhabitants,[1] it is the
                    10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish-speakers. Mexico is organized as a federal
                    republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital. Other major urban areas include
                    Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and León.[12]
                </p>
                Pre-Columbian Mexico traces its origins to 8,000 BCE and is identified as one of the world's six cradles
                of civilization.[13] In particular, the Mesoamerican region was home to many intertwined civilizations;
                including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha. Last were the Aztecs, who dominated the
                region in the century before European contact. In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies
                conquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), establishing the colony of
                New Spain.[14] Over the next three centuries, Spain and the Catholic Church played an important role
                expanding the territory, enforcing Christianity and spreading the Spanish language throughout.[15] With
                the discovery of rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain soon became one of the
                most important mining centers worldwide. Wealth coming from Asia and the New World contributed to
                Spain's status as a major world power for the next centuries, and brought about a price revolution in
                Western Europe.[16] The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the War of
                Independence against Spain.
                </p>
                Mexico's early history as an independent nation state was marked by political and socioeconomic
                upheaval, both domestically and in foreign affairs. The country was invaded by two foreign powers during
                the 19th century: first, by the United States as a consequence of the Texas Revolt by American settlers,
                which led to the Mexican–American War and huge territorial losses in 1848.[17] After the introduction of
                liberal reforms in the Constitution of 1857, conservatives reacted with the war of Reform and prompted
                France to invade the country and install an Empire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal
                President Benito Juárez, which emerged victorious. The last decades of the 19th century were dominated
                by the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order.[18] However, the
                Porfiriato era led to great social unrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-long Mexican
                Revolution (civil war). This conflict had profound changes in Mexican society, including the
                proclamation of the 1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day. The remaining war generals
                ruled as a succession of presidents until the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) emerged in 1929.
                The PRI in turn governed Mexico for the next 70 years, first under a set of paternalistic developmental
                policies of considerable economic success. During World War II Mexico also played an important role for
                the U.S. war effort.[19][20] Nonetheless, the PRI regime resorted to repression and electoral fraud to
                maintain power; and moved the country to a more US-aligned neoliberal economic policy during the late
                20th century. This culminated with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which
                caused a major indigenous rebellion in the state of Chiapas. PRI lost the presidency for the first time
                in 2000, against the conservative party (PAN).

                    Mexico is a developing country, ranking 74th on the Human Development Index, but has the world's
                    15th-largest economy by nominal GDP and the 11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its
                    largest economic partner. Its large economy and population, cultural influence, and steady
                    democratization make Mexico a regional and middle power;[21][22][23][24] it is often identified as
                    an emerging power but is considered a newly industrialized state by several
                    analysts.[25][26][27][28][29] Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world for the
                    number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[30] It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries,
                    ranking fifth in natural biodiversity.[31] Mexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well
                    as varied climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth
                    most-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals.[32] However, the country
                    continues to struggle with social inequality, poverty and extensive crime. It ranks poorly on the
                    Global Peace Index,[33] due in large part to ongoing conflict between the government and drug
                    trafficking syndicates, which violently compete for the US drug market and trade routes. This "drug
                    war" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006.[34] Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20,
                    the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization
                    (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community
                    of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.

                    Argentina (Spanish pronunciation: [aɾxenˈtina] (listen)), officially the Argentine Republic[A]
                    (Spanish: República Argentina), is a country in the southern half of South America. Argentina covers
                    an area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] making it the second-largest country in South America
                    after Brazil, the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the
                    world. It shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, and is also bordered by
                    Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to
                    the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. Argentina is a federal state subdivided into
                    twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of
                    the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist
                    under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over a part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands
                    and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
                </p>
                The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.[16]
                The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times. The country has its
                roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century.[17] Argentina rose as the successor
                state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata,[18] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The
                declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted
                until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation. The country thereafter enjoyed
                relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards,
                radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; over 60% of the population has full or partial
                Italian ancestry,[19][20][21] and Argentine culture has significant connections to Italian culture.[22]
                <p>
                    The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh-wealthiest
                    nation in the world by the early 20th century.[23][24][25] In 1896, Argentina's GDP per capita
                    surpassed that of the United States[26] and was consistently in the top ten before at least
                    1920.[27][28] Currently, it is ranked 89th in the world. Following the Great Depression in the
                    1930s, Argentina descended into political instability and economic decline that pushed it back into
                    underdevelopment,[29] although it remained among the fifteen richest countries for several
                    decades.[23] Following the death of President Juan Perón in 1974, his widow and vice president,
                    Isabel Perón, ascended to the presidency, before being overthrown in 1976. The following military
                    junta, which was supported by the United States, persecuted and murdered thousands of political
                    critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism and civil unrest that
                    lasted until the election of Raúl Alfonsín as president in 1983.

                    Argentina is a regional power, and retains its historic status as a middle power in international
                    affairs.[30][31][32] A Major non-NATO ally,[33] Argentina is a developing country that ranks 46th in
                    the Human Development Index, the second-highest in Latin America after Chile. It maintains the
                    second-largest economy in South America, and is a member of G-15 and G20. Argentina is also a
                    founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Community of
                    Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States. Since January
                    2022 Argentina is an OECD candidate country.[34]

                    India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia.
                    It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous
                    democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest,
                    and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China,
                    Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India
                    is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime
                    border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.

                    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years
                    ago.[27][28][29] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers,
                    has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled
                    life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,
                    evolving gradually into the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31] By 1200 BCE,
                    an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
                    northwest,[32][33] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism
                    in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western
                    regions.[35] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36] and
                    Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37] Early political
                    consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38]
                    Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining
                    status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of
                    belief.[g][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and
                    religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on
                    India's southern and western coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran
                    India's
                    northern plains,[44] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the
                    cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
                    long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting
                    institutionalised religion.[47] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
                    peace,[48] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British
                    East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
                    sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
                    slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the
                    public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was
                    noted
                    for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the
                    British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a
                    Hindu-majority
                    Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an
                    unprecedented migration.[60]

                    India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
                    pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951
                    to 1.211 billion in 2011.[61] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from
                    US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively
                    destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for
                    information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] It has a space programme which
                    includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual
                    teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[64] India has substantially reduced its rate of
                    poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65] India is a nuclear-weapon state,
                    which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan
                    and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66] Among the socio-economic challenges India
                    faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67] and rising levels of air pollution.[68] India's
                    land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its
                    area.[70] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's
                    culture,[71] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.
